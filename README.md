These are lectures/workbooks are based on a notebook Jeff McMahon prepared for the 2015 La Serena data science summer school and were addapted and expanded for the CMB Analysis Summer School held at the University of Michigan, August 29-30 2016 by Renee Hlozek and Jeff McMahon.  Renee added the the FFT intro, the example analysis of ACT data, and the cosmological paramter analysis.  Sigurd Naess contributed the notebook on Mapmaking techniques.  The notebooks are based on the Anaconda distribution of Python 3 which can be downloaded here:  https://www.anaconda.com.  We have made every effort to user as few specialized libraries as possible.  Thoough this was not possible for the excercise on liklihoods.  Download these notebooks and use the Jupyter Notebook enviroment to work with them.
