    "# Introduction to Data Analysis Techniques for Cosmic Microwave Background  Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jeff McMahon and Renée Hložek \n",
    "\n",
    "The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the oldest observable light in the universe. As such it carries a wealth of cosmological information including: (1) signals from the early universe (primary anisotropy), and (2) distortions imprinted as this light propagates through the universe and encounters collapsed structures (secondary anisotropy).  Measurements of these signals give us important measurements and constraints on inflationary parameters, dark energy, dark matter, the sum of the neutrino masses, and many astrophysical processes.  The development of CMB instruments and analysis techniques is rapidly evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to analysis techniques for CMB maps as they pertain to high resolution CMB instruments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the South Pole Telescope (SPT).  These state of the art instruments have thousands of detectors (pixels) deployed on 6 and 10 meter telescopes which produce arc minute resolution beams at 150 GHz.  These telescopes observe by scanning across the sky.  The data from each detector are read out at high speed (typically > 50 Hz) to produce 'detector time streams' which are recored along with pointing information and other ancillary data.  Sophisticated codes are used to convert these time streams into maps of the CMB sky.  These maps can have correlated noise that must be accounted for in data analysis.   The mapmaking algorithms are not described here but represent a very interesting big data challenge as they require cleaning time streams by filtering, identifying transient events, and ultimately compressing ~Tb of data down to maps that are typically 100 Mb or less.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are example maps from SPT (top, taken from a phys.org article from April 2, 2012 titled \"South Pole Telescope hones in on dark energy, neutrinos\") and ACTPol (bottom, taken from the Naess et al. 2014 CMB polarization paper).  Many features are obvious in these maps including: (1) the primary CMB visible as waves in the intensity, (2) active galactic nuclei and other bright astrophysical point sources which manifest as bright dots, (3) clusters of galaxies which show up as darkened point sources, and (4) horizontal stripes (in the SPT map) that are the result of the noise and map filtering.  The ACTPol figure shows multiple maps; the T is temperature, Q and U are polarization, and E and B are also polarization but decomposed into a basis such that the E is the amplitude of the curl-free component, and B is the amplitude of the divergence free component of the polarization vector field.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current instruments (ACTPol and SPTPol) have multiple frequencies and polarization sensitivity, for simplicity we consider only a single frequency (150 GHz) and only temperature.  Adding extra frequency channels or polarization add the cost of slightly more work and would make this presentation more confusing.  Therefore we leave these complications for a future treatment and focus on temperature alone.  This allows us to show the basics of monty carlo analysis of both the angular power spectrum and matched filter techniques for studying Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short course is organized as follows.   We beginning by building simulation of the CMB sky including the primary CMB, point sources (AGN and dusty galaxies), the SZ effect, and (if time) CMB lensing.   To these maps, we fold in instrumental effects including the beam, instrument and atmospheric noise.  We then present several analysis techniques including monty carlo estimation of power spectra and matched filter techniques for extraction of sources    An example of a stacking analysis is presented as an example of a cross-correlation with external data sets.  Cross-correlation is a very active field of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interest of simplicity we use approximate distributions for source and SZ counts with combinations of exponential and poisson distributions.   We note explicitly where we make these approximations."

    "The majority of the information content of the CMB is contained in its angular power spectrum.   This spectrum is the amplitude squared of the magnitude of the temperature fluctuations as a function of $\\ell$.  Here $\\ell$ is the variable you have seen before with the spherical harmonics (e.g., $Y_{\\ell m}$).  $\\ell = 0$ corresponds to a constant temperature across the sky, $\\ell = 200$ corresponds approximately to scales of $1^\\circ$.  For a given set of input cosmological parameters these spectra can be computed with codes including CMBFAST or the more modern equivalent CAMB. \n",

If we were generating a map on the full sky we would need to work with spherical harmonics.  Here we consider a small patch of sky $(\\sim 10^\\circ \\times 10^\\circ)$ where we can use the \"flat-sky\" approximation and replace $\\ell$ with $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$.  There is a linear dependence between these variables defined by $\\ell = k* 2 \\pi$.\n",

We provide a function to do this and a function to plot this (and other maps) with a uniform color scale."
