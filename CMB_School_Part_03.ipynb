    "\n",
    "Ground based CMB instruments suffer from several types of noise.  This includes: (1) White noise drawn from a gaussian distribution; (2) atmospheric noise which grows larger on large angular scales, this can be understood in terms of Kolmogorov turbulence; and (3) $1/f$ noise in the detectors.  Both atmospheric and detector $1/f$ manifest as correlated noise in map space.  However, like the CMB these noise components are very nearly uncorrelated in Fourier space.  We will build these noise terms in Fourier space and display them in map space. \n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a white noise level of 10 $\\mu\\mathrm{K}$-arcmin to approximate the current deep maps coming from ACTPol and SPTPol.  The $1/f$ noise is similar to what would be seen in an experiment at the south pole.  When turned on, this noise leads to the effect of \"striping\" in the maps.  In later notebooks, we default to turning the atmospheric and 1/f noise components off since if they are included we may want to filter the maps before estimating the power spectrum.  (This is easy, but is not yet implemented).  The atmospheric noise (Kolmogorov turbulence) has a 2D spectrum similar to CMB leading to similar patterns in the maps."

For both atmospheric and $1/f$ noise, a high pass filter would be an effective choice.  This could either be a square filter (where the modes below some cutoff are set to zero while shorter wavelength modes are kept unchanged) or a filter that weights the fourier modes by $1/A$ where $A$ is the amplitude of the noise distribution.    Below is code that masks out $N_{mask}$ fourier modes along the scan direction.  See the exercise below and play with it."
